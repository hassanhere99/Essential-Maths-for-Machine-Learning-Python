# Essential Maths for Machine Learning Python

If you know Python and have little bit knowledge of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib Library, you can start. Otherwise first go through 'Basic Python for Data Science'  and then start this course. This course will clear your math concepts that are essential for Data Science. It includes detailed explanations and python codes in jupyter files to understand the concepts.
The course is divided in four modules.

1- Module one is of Equations, Graphs and Functions.

2- Module two is of Derivatives and Optimization.

3- Module three is of Vectors and Matrices.

4- Module four is of Statistics and Probability.

I have named the files according to the modules. Open the file sequence wise and read the explanations and try to understand the codes and compile them.
